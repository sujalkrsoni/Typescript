# 📘 Union & Intersection in Property-Based Sets

---

## 🧠 1. Starting Point: Universal Set

Let’s define our **universal set (U)**:

> **U = All learners enrolled in this TypeScript course**

Each learner has the following properties:

* name
* age
* city
* qualification
* occupation

---

## 🧩 2. What are Property-Based Sets?

A **property-based set** is defined by applying conditions on the properties of an object.

👉 Think of each set as a **filter applied on the Universal Set**

---

## 🔵 3. Define Two Sets

### Set A

Learners who satisfy:

* age = 20
* city = Delhi
* qualification = B.Tech

👉
**A = { learners : age = 20 AND city = Delhi AND qualification = B.Tech }**

---

### Set B

Learners who satisfy:

* occupation = student
* city = Delhi
* qualification = BCA

👉
**B = { learners : occupation = student AND city = Delhi AND qualification = BCA }**

---

## 🔷 4. UNION of Sets (A ∪ B)

### 📌 Definition

> A ∪ B = learners who satisfy **A OR B**

So a learner can:

* belong to A
* OR belong to B
* OR belong to both

---

### 🧠 What property can we GUARANTEE?

Let’s check each property:

| Property      | Guaranteed in A ∪ B? | Why                     |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| city = Delhi  | ✅ Yes                | Present in both A and B |
| age = 20      | ❌ No                 | Only in A               |
| occupation    | ❌ No                 | Only in B               |
| qualification | ❌ No                 | B.Tech in A, BCA in B   |

---

### 🔥 Key Insight

👉 In **UNION**, the set becomes bigger  
👉 So guarantees become smaller

---

### ✅ Final Statement

> **A ∪ B guarantees only what is common in both sets**

👉 Here:

```
Only guarantee → city = Delhi
```

---

## 🔴 5. INTERSECTION of Sets (A ∩ B)

### 📌 Definition

> A ∩ B = learners who satisfy **A AND B**

So a learner must satisfy:

* all conditions of A
* AND all conditions of B

---

### 🧠 Combine conditions

From A:

* age = 20
* city = Delhi
* qualification = B.Tech

From B:

* occupation = student
* city = Delhi
* qualification = BCA

---

### ⚠️ Important Observation

Here we get:

* qualification = B.Tech
* qualification = BCA

👉 This is a **conflict**

---

### ❌ Result

> No learner can satisfy both simultaneously

👉 So:

```
A ∩ B = ∅ (empty set)
```

---

## 🟡 6. Fixing the Example (to see intersection clearly)

Let’s slightly adjust Set B:

---

### New Set B

* occupation = student
* city = Delhi
* qualification = B.Tech

---

### Now Intersection:

From A:

* age = 20
* city = Delhi
* qualification = B.Tech

From B:

* occupation = student
* city = Delhi
* qualification = B.Tech

---

### ✅ Result

```
A ∩ B = {
  learners :
  age = 20 AND
  occupation = student AND
  city = Delhi AND
  qualification = B.Tech
}
```

---

### 🧠 What can we GUARANTEE?

| Property      | Guaranteed? |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| age = 20      | ✅ Yes       |
| occupation    | ✅ Yes       |
| city = Delhi  | ✅ Yes       |
| qualification | ✅ Yes       |

---

### 🔥 Key Insight

👉 In **INTERSECTION**, the set becomes smaller  
👉 So guarantees become larger

---

## ⚡ 7. Final Core Concept

### 🧠 Golden Rules

👉 **Union of sets ⇒ Intersection of guarantees**  
👉 **Intersection of sets ⇒ Union of guarantees**

---

## 🎯 8. Intuition (Very Important)

### Union (A ∪ B)

* Bigger group
* Mixed learners
* Less certainty

👉 “We can only say what is common”

---

### Intersection (A ∩ B)

* Smaller group
* Strict filtering
* More certainty

👉 “We can say everything confidently”

## 🧩 9. Final One-Line Takeaway

👉 **The more values you allow (union), the fewer guarantees you have**  
👉 **The fewer values you allow (intersection), the more guarantees you get**
