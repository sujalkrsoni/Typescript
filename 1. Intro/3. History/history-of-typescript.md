# 🚀 How TypeScript Was Born and Took Over

Around 2010, something big happened.

JavaScript engines became insanely fast. Chrome’s V8, Microsoft’s Chakra, Mozilla’s engine, the web suddenly became **10x to 100x faster**.

Now think about what that means.

If JavaScript is fast, you can build serious applications in the browser.

So Microsoft looked at massive products like:

- Word  
- Excel  
- PowerPoint  

These were huge C++ codebases. Millions of lines. Thousands of developers.

And now they had to move to JavaScript.

And that’s where reality hit.

JavaScript at the time:

- Had no static types  
- Had weak tooling  
- Made refactoring dangerous  
- Let simple typos survive until runtime  
- Was painful for large teams  

Developers were spending half a day debugging bugs caused by spelling mistakes.

The web was ready for large applications.

JavaScript was not.

# 💡 The Question That Changed Everything

Do we replace JavaScript?

Or do we fix it?

Some companies chose replacement. Google had Dart. Others had compile-to-JS experiments.

But inside Microsoft, the thinking was different:

> The web will win. JavaScript will win.  
> So we must build on top of it, not fight it.

That’s the philosophical foundation of TypeScript.

# 🧠 Enter Anders Hejlsberg

Steve Lucco and Luke Hoban started experimenting with ideas. They were thinking about adding types and better tooling.

Then Anders Hejlsberg joined the effort.

If you know C#… you know Anders.

He was skeptical at first. He doesn’t casually build new languages.

But once he dug into the problem, he realized:

There *is* real programming language design work needed here.

Not a replacement language.

An extension.

# 🏗️ The Core Design Decisions

This part is important.

TypeScript was never meant to compete with JavaScript.

It was designed to be:

- A strict superset of JavaScript  
- Optional in its typing  
- Compiled back into plain JavaScript 

---

# 🛠 The VS Code Symbiosis

At the same time, Microsoft was building a new code editor and that editor became VS Code.

TypeScript and VS Code grew together. They stress-tested each other.

Without TypeScript, VS Code would not exist in its current form.

And VS Code helped TypeScript grow by giving constant real-world feedback.

# 🌊 Now Comes the Hard Part: Open Source

Here’s where things get dramatic.

In 2012, Microsoft was not open-source friendly.

In fact, it had a reputation problem.

There was fear in the community:

“Is this Microsoft trying to embrace, extend, extinguish JavaScript?”

Internally, it was even harder.

At the time, Microsoft’s business model was based on:

- Proprietary licensed software  
- Closed ecosystems  

So when the TypeScript team said:

> This must be open source. And free.

Management was confused.

“What is the business value?”

Convincing leadership required:

- Developer division approval  
- Internet Explorer team approval  
- Internal open-source policy teams  
- Multiple layers of management  

It took about six months of advocacy.

# 🚀 Launch Day: October 1, 2012

TypeScript was officially launched on **October 1, 2012**, at the GOTO Conference in Denmark.

The team released it the night before the talk.

Anders walked on stage. [Talk Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqZW_DqHIQ)

And TypeScript entered the world.

At that moment, it was hosted on **CodePlex**, Microsoft’s own open-source hosting platform.

Initial reaction?

Small but passionate.

No massive explosion.
No instant takeover.

But something important had started.

Developers were curious.
The idea of optional static typing for JavaScript felt bold.
Different.
Controversial, even.

And behind the scenes, a much bigger decision was brewing.

# 🧨 CodePlex vs GitHub: The Crucial Battle

When TypeScript launched, it lived on **CodePlex**.

That made sense from Microsoft’s point of view.

But there was a problem.

The JavaScript community was not on CodePlex.

It was on GitHub.

If TypeScript wanted real adoption, it had to live where developers already were.

Not where Microsoft preferred them to be.

The team had to convince leadership.

This was not a small discussion.

Moving to GitHub meant:

* Letting go of internal control
* Accepting external contributions
* Working fully in public
* Being open to criticism
* Shifting company culture

It took about **two years** of internal convincing.

Finally, in **2014**, the decision was made.

TypeScript moved to GitHub.

The first commit in the GitHub repository was made on July 8, 2014. [First Commit Link](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commit/99ec3a96880649eeaa08c3df30e3ae802048f4fe) 

That moment changed everything.

From that point forward, adoption accelerated.
Community involvement increased.
Trust grew.

And something even bigger happened.

This GitHub-first approach later became a broader open-source policy shift inside Microsoft.

What started as a battle for one language helped reshape an entire company’s relationship with open source.

# 💎 DefinitelyTyped: The Community Multiplier

Four days after launch first launch of TypeScript in 2012, a community member created:    

**DefinitelyTyped**

A repository for type definitions of existing JavaScript libraries.

Think about how important that is.

Without type definitions, TypeScript would be isolated.

With DefinitelyTyped, any JavaScript library could be typed.

Microsoft could have blocked it.

They didn’t.

That trust decision mattered.

Later, the integration of `@types` on npm made type definitions seamless.

This was a massive turning point.

The ecosystem started compounding.

# ⚔️ The Rival Philosophies

Meanwhile:

- Google was pushing Dart to replace JavaScript.
- Facebook was building Flow for type checking.

The debate was real.

Replace JavaScript?

Or evolve it?

Time proved something important.

The web does not like being replaced.

TypeScript’s strategy of upgrading JavaScript instead of fighting it turned out to be the winning bet.

---

# 🔥 Angular and the Adoption Explosion

Then came a huge moment.

Angular 2 chose TypeScript.

This was not small.

Angular had hundreds of thousands of developers.

Suddenly, huge numbers of people were “forcefully onboarded” to TypeScript.

Decorators were introduced partly because Angular needed them.

This led to collaboration between:

- Microsoft  
- Google  
- Angular team  

Google eventually went through an intense internal process to officially adopt TypeScript.

This was historic.

Google is extremely conservative with adding new languages.

TypeScript made it onto the approved list.

That gave it enormous credibility.

---

# 🏛 Alignment With TC39

Another major evolution:

Instead of extending JavaScript independently forever, the TypeScript team started actively participating in TC39.

They helped advance features like:

- Optional chaining  
- Decorators  

The philosophy matured into:

Don’t swim against the current.

Work with the standard.

Converge with JavaScript.

---

# 🌐 The Ecosystem Strategy

TypeScript didn’t try to dominate frameworks.

It worked with:

- Angular  
- React  
- Vue  
- Svelte  
- Babel  
- esbuild  
- Deno  

It positioned itself as infrastructure.

It sits between:

Your framework  
and  
JavaScript itself  

That’s a powerful layer.

Nothing else lives exactly there.

---

# 🧘 The Flow Rivalry and the Calm After

For years, Flow was a serious competitor.

People argued online.

Facebook vs Microsoft.

But Flow’s focus shifted inward to Meta.

TypeScript kept focusing outward on the community.

Eventually:

TypeScript became the default.

The arguments stopped.

---

# 🔄 The Cultural Impact on Microsoft

This might be the most underrated part of the story.

TypeScript was one of the first major Microsoft projects to go fully open source on GitHub.

It proved:

- Open source could benefit Microsoft  
- Trust-building worked  
- Community collaboration paid off  

After that:

- VS Code went open source  
- .NET went open source  
- Microsoft became one of the largest open-source contributors globally  

TypeScript helped change Microsoft’s culture.

---

# 🧠 The Core Philosophy That Won

Let’s boil it down.

TypeScript succeeded because it:

- Respected JavaScript  
- Respected the web  
- Respected the community  
- Chose GitHub over CodePlex  
- Chose collaboration over control  
- Chose evolution over replacement  

It wasn’t flashy.

It was patient.

And it compounded.

---

# ❤️ Final Thought

JavaScript was messy.

But it wasn’t broken enough to replace.

It just needed structure.

TypeScript didn’t try to overthrow the web.

It quietly made it professional.

And that quiet decision changed modern web development forever.
